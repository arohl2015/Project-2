## Overview: 
_Assimilate was created by our team for Project 2 of of the University of Arizona Bootcamp. Our idea was to create an application that could be used by our classmates - a flashcard app (modeled after Quizlet) that allows the user to study coding topics off of a deck of different cards. The MVC model is used for folder structure, and sequelized is used for storing data. 

For our new technologies, Materialize was used to create the client-side UI. For authentication of users, Passport.js was used and set to work with our local database storage.
